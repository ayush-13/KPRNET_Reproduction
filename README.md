The blog post for the this project is available at: https://hackmd.io/NXTmtQ1dSg6sig4G80XFFA#fnref2   

The objective of this project is to reproduce the results of the original work, examine the effects of hyperparameters changes as well as use a new algorithm varient.   

In order to obtain the results of this project, replace the files in the original source code with the files provided here, and use the provided network weights for the 2 experiments.
